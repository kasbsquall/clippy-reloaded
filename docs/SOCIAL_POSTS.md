### Variation 1 - Spec-Driven Focus
📎 I resurrected Clippy using @kirodotdev and he's actually helpful now!

Spec-driven development + steering docs + MCP servers = an AI assistant that knows what you're working on and actually helps.

### Variation 2 - Steering Docs Focus
Built Clippy Reloaded with @kirodotdev - an AI assistant that knows its own personality.

Steering docs meant every response matched Clippy's self-deprecating humor. No prompt engineering each time.

### Variation 3 - Full Stack Focus
Clippy Reloaded: specs, steering, hooks, and MCP servers all working together.

@kirodotdev made building an agentic AI assistant feel like following a recipe instead of improvising.

### Variation 1 - Development Process
**How Spec-Driven Development Changed Everything**

I just built Clippy Reloaded for the Kiro Hackathon using @kirodotdev, and the experience fundamentally changed how I approach software development.

Instead of diving into code, Kiro's spec workflow forced me to define EARS-compliant requirements first. From requirements, I moved to design with correctness properties, then to an implementation plan with incremental tasks. The result? A working AI assistant with context detection, MCP server integration, and a self-aware personality—all built systematically instead of chaotically.

### Variation 2 - AI-Assisted Development
**Steering AI Without Constant Prompting**

Building Clippy Reloaded with @kirodotdev taught me something valuable: the best AI assistance comes from persistent context, not repeated prompts.

Kiro's steering documents let me define Clippy's personality once—self-deprecating humor, action-oriented responses, never saying "It looks like you're writing a letter." Every code generation respected those guidelines automatically. Combined with hooks that ran tests on every save and specs that traced requirements to implementation, I shipped a working AI assistant with confidence I rarely feel in rapid development.

### Variation 1 - Casual/Fun
📎 Plot twist: I made Clippy actually helpful.

Used @kirodotdev for the Kiro Hackathon and the spec-driven workflow is *chef's kiss*. 

Steering docs → Specs → Hooks → MCP Servers

All working together. Clippy Reloaded knows what you're viewing and actually helps.

### Variation 2 - Process Focus
The best thing about @kirodotdev? Everything connects.

- Steering docs define personality
- Specs define requirements → design → tasks
- Hooks automate builds/tests
- MCP servers add real capabilities

Built Clippy Reloaded with all four. The paperclip is back and he's actually useful.
